# Code-Refactor-Horiseon

This project consists of a business webpage refactored by HTML and CSS in order to improve search engine optimization, scale marketing presence on social media, ensure interface accessibility, and anticipate and manage  threats of ill repute through organized code.

The condensed coding of this projectâ€™s assets make it more accessible, legible, and enables productive  
and expeditious colleague contribution. 

Additionally, the clean and modified code allows for the swift (hopefully merficul) justice of teacher and TA commentary, revision, and grading. 

I found this to be a sufficiently challenging trial exercise in applying industry standards to a would-be paid assignment in a professional setting.
